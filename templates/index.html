            <p>Are you a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill? Hopefully. Otherwise, this website is not going to be very useful to you.</p>
            <p>Like any good college student who is responsible with their money, you probably have a budget(yet you defintely spend more money on coffee at Stone and Leaf than you realize.
                It's okay. We've all been there.)
            </p>
            <p>Budgeting for a trip is very important, but that doesn't mean that you can't still visit somewhere beautiful with lots of fun things to do. 
                There are a lot of factors that go into planning a trip, but cost and interest are probably the two most important factors. How can you plan a trip without knowing how much money you can spend?
                How can you save up all this money and have absolutely zero interest in the place you are doing to?
