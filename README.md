# Ballin on a Budget
 
Our travel website (Ballin on a Budget) gives UNC students the perfect place to travel based on their budget. We understand college students are broke, but adventurous. So, we want to help them find the best spring or winter break spot that won't break their bank account. Although, if like spending money we have options for that too!

The first page introduces students to our website and the purpose of it.

The second page prompts the user for a budget. Students have to pick from a range of prices. $ being the least expensive and $$$ being the most expensive. The webiste will also take into consideration the type of location students would like. They can choose from city, beach, or wilderness.

Once they choose these options, the website will give them their perfect destination. We have a total of 9 options that can be potentially picked for the user.

Users could also choose their location without taking the quiz. On the homepage there is a list of location types that users can click on. Each link will take the user to a page of three destination options based on the location type selected. The user can then click on the image or name of the place they would like to visit and they will be taken to the page dedicated to the destination they selected.

Our teams consists of us, Chiara Sabato & Norah Binny. Chiara created the main frame of the website, focused on the styling of the website, connected each of the pages, and created the opening pages. Norah worked on creating pages for each place and gathering information on them. As a team we both came up with the idea of our website, reseached APIs, embedded images, and worked on changing colors of our text.

We used 110 programming concepts such as creating helper functions and importing them. We used helper functions to take in user data and provide them with data. We also used functions in the app.py file to route to different pages of our website when the user clicked on specific links. 

The most challenging part about our project was trying to figure out how to import APIs, directing our website to go to different sites based on data input, and embedding images. We ended up not figuring out how to sucessfully use APIs. Instead we typed up our information direclty and found out how to embed images without using APIs. We defintely want to learn how use APIs in the furture though. It would also be nice to store different users and the places they went, that way other students could see where their fellow classmates ended up matching with. Also, after much work, Chiara did a great job connecting the paths of our pages. Embedding images took some TA help, but we figured it out. We learned a lot about website building with this project. We became more comfortable working with html, embedding images, changing fonts/colors and more.
