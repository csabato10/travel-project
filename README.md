Travel website that gives UNC students the perfect place to travel based on their budget.

First page prompts the user for a budget and the type of location they would like to travel. 

Once they choose these options, the website will give them their perfect destination. 

The most challenging part abour our project was trying to figure out how to import APIs and directing our website to go to different sites based on data input.
